### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter where Leo must deliver a message to a forgotten river spirit trapped in the pipes beneath Rome's modern streets.
- Create a 'Field Guide to Rome's Hidden Magic' from Leo's perspective, detailing rules, landmarks, and dangers.
- Write a 'prequel' short story about Leo's great-uncle Aurelio and the magical book restoration that first attuned him to the city's layers.
- Draft a series of 'Cobblestone Tales'—very short stories (100-300 words) about the specific memory or sigh contained within a single stone on Leo's route.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of Rome where users can click on landmarks to reveal 'hidden' magical lore, whispers, or memories from the story.
- Create a 'Magical Postal System Simulator' where the player, as a portalettere, must manage a route, prioritize deliveries, and navigate the constraints of both the mundane and magical cities.
